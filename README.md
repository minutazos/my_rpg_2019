Epitech educational project

## Statings at pushing it
Clone of The Legend of Zelda NES using the CSFML library

There are some additional mechanics in order to fulfill project requisites.

** Made with Nathan Casabielle and Thomas Samson **

## Projections for this project
The idea is to remake it, with a more robust architecture and doing a pure clone of the original game, without any extra feature.
